# Dreaming Print Solutions
## Indigenous Procurement Strategy Report

**Prepared for:** Ben & Zac (Business Owners)
**Date:** December 2024
**Classification:** Internal Strategy Document

---

## Executive Summary

Dreaming Print Solutions (DPS) is positioned at the intersection of two powerful market forces:

1. **Growing demand for enterprise print solutions** in government and corporate sectors
2. **Mandatory Indigenous procurement requirements** creating preferential pathways for Indigenous-owned businesses

This report provides a complete analysis of how DPS can leverage its Indigenous ownership to win contracts that would otherwise require competitive tendering, while maintaining focus on being a premium HP enterprise print solutions provider.

**Key Finding:** For Commonwealth contracts between $80,000-$200,000, government buyers are *required by law* to consider Indigenous suppliers first. For contracts of *any value*, buyers can use Exemption 16 to purchase directly from Indigenous SMEs without open tender.

**Bottom Line:** Your Indigenous ownership isn't just a differentiator—it's a legal procurement advantage worth millions in accessible contracts.

---

## Part 1: Understanding Your Procurement Advantage

### 1.1 The Indigenous Procurement Policy (IPP)

The Commonwealth IPP isn't a "nice to have" diversity initiative—it's embedded in the Commonwealth Procurement Rules and is legally binding on all government buyers.

#### Three Mechanisms That Benefit DPS:

| Mechanism | Contract Value | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Mandatory Set Aside (MSA)** | $80,000 - $200,000 | Buyers MUST search Supply Nation first, MUST give you opportunity to quote, MUST award if you demonstrate value for money |
| **Exemption 16** | Any value | Buyers CAN purchase directly from Indigenous SMEs without open tender at any contract value |
| **Mandatory Minimum Requirements (MMR)** | $7.5M+ | Large contractors need Indigenous suppliers in their supply chain to win major bids |

### 1.2 What "Mandatory Set Aside" Actually Means

For any Commonwealth procurement between $80,000-$200,000 (GST inclusive) delivered wholly in Australia:

1. **Step 1:** Buyer searches Supply Nation's Indigenous Business Directory
2. **Step 2:** Buyer must approach capable Indigenous businesses to quote
3. **Step 3:** If Indigenous business demonstrates "value for money" → contract awarded
4. **Step 4:** Only if no Indigenous supplier can deliver → open market

**This is not discretionary.** Government procurement officers must follow this process or face audit scrutiny.

**Your Sweet Spot:** Enterprise MFP contracts typically range $50,000-$150,000—directly in the MSA zone.

### 1.3 Exemption 16: The Game-Changer

Most people focus on the $80K-$200K threshold. The bigger opportunity is Exemption 16.

**What Exemption 16 Allows:**
- Direct procurement from Indigenous SMEs (under 200 employees) at **any contract value**
- No competitive tender required
- Simple quote process
- Appropriate sign-off based on value

**What This Means for DPS:**
- A $500,000 whole-of-department MFP rollout? Direct approach possible.
- A $2M managed print services contract? Direct approach possible.
- The only requirement is demonstrating "value for money" (which includes social benefit).

### 1.4 "Value for Money" Is Not "Cheapest Price"

This is critical to understand. Commonwealth Procurement Rules define value for money as:

- Quality and fitness for purpose
- Supplier capability and experience
- Risk mitigation
- **Social and economic benefits** (including Indigenous employment/ownership)
- Ethical conduct
- Total cost of ownership

**The $4.41 Multiplier:**
Supply Nation research proves that for every $1 spent with an Indigenous business, $4.41 of social value is generated. This is a *quantifiable benefit* that procurement officers can legitimately include in value assessments.

**Translation:** You don't need to be the cheapest. You need to be competitive while delivering the same quality products, and the social value tips the scales.

## Part 2: The Market Opportunity

### 2.1 Government Spending on Indigenous Procurement

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total contracts since 2015 | $12.9 billion |
| Contracts awarded | 83,500+ |
| Indigenous businesses benefited | 4,600+ |
| FY2023-24 spend | $5.83 billion |
| Annual social value generated | $42.6 billion |

### 2.2 Increasing Targets (Your Market is Growing)

Government departments face increasing Indigenous procurement targets:

| Financial Year | Target |
|----------------|--------|
| 2024-25 | 2.5% |
| 2025-26 | 3.0% |
| 2026-27 | 3.25% |
| 2027-28 | 3.5% |
| 2028-29 | 3.75% |
| 2029-30 | 4.0% |

**What This Means:** Procurement officers are under increasing pressure to find Indigenous suppliers. Demand for your services will grow every year through 2030.

### 2.3 State Government Policies

It's not just Commonwealth. State governments have similar requirements:

| State | Policy | Key Detail |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **Queensland** | QIPP | 3% addressable spend target, $440M spent in FY21-22 |
| **NSW** | Aboriginal Procurement Policy | First consideration up to $250K, 3% contract target |
| **Victoria** | Social Procurement Framework | 1% SME procurement, targets required for $20M+ contracts |
| **Western Australia** | Aboriginal Procurement Policy | Priority consideration for Indigenous businesses |

**Queensland Advantage:** As a Brisbane-based business, you have home-market advantage for QLD government contracts.

---

## Part 3: Target Market Analysis

### 3.1 Government Buyers

**Primary Targets:**
- Commonwealth departments (all subject to IPP)
- Queensland Government agencies
- Local councils with Indigenous procurement policies
- Universities (many have Indigenous procurement strategies)

**What They're Buying:**
- Multifunction printers/copiers
- Managed print services
- Document management solutions
- Print fleet assessments and optimization

**Their Pain Points:**
- Meeting Indigenous procurement targets (KPIs)
- Audit compliance documentation
- Finding quality Indigenous suppliers in specific categories
- Lengthy tender processes they'd prefer to avoid

**Your Solution:**
- Same HP enterprise products as any other dealer
- Direct procurement pathway saves them time
- Helps them meet targets while getting quality equipment
- Supply Nation certification = verified, audit-ready

### 3.2 Corporate Buyers

**Why Corporations Buy from Indigenous Suppliers:**

1. **Reconciliation Action Plans (RAPs)** - 2,500+ Australian organizations have RAPs with procurement targets
2. **ESG Reporting** - Indigenous procurement is measurable social impact for sustainability reports
3. **Tender Advantage** - Companies bidding on government contracts need Indigenous supply chain for MMR compliance
4. **Stakeholder Expectations** - Shareholders, employees, customers expect supplier diversity

**High-Value Corporate Targets (Companies with Active RAPs):**

| Company | RAP Level | Indigenous Spend | Print Opportunity |
|---------|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Commonwealth Bank | Elevate | $62M+ FY25 | Branch operations, forms |
| NAB | Stretch | Significant | Branch network, marketing |
| BHP | Elevate | $300M+ annually | Site offices, operations |
| Rio Tinto | Elevate | $725M (2023) | Remote site operations |
| Telstra | Elevate | $15M/year | Retail, offices |
| Lendlease | Elevate | Growing | Construction offices |
| Deloitte | Stretch (pending) | Growing | Proposals, reports |
| KPMG | Elevate | Significant | Audit documentation |

**Queensland-Specific Targets:**

| Organization | RAP Level | Notes |
|--------------|-----------|-------|
| Queensland Government | Stretch | Multi-agency opportunity |
| University of Queensland | Stretch | Indigenous Procurement Strategy 2022-2025 |
| Griffith University | Active | Brisbane-based, established since 2010 |
| UnitingCare Queensland | Stretch | Healthcare/social services |
| GHD (Engineering) | Stretch | July 2025, expanding procurement |

### 3.3 Tier 1 Contractors (Indirect Opportunity)

For contracts over $7.5M in certain sectors, contractors must achieve either:
- 4% Indigenous workforce, OR
- 4% subcontracted to Indigenous businesses

**What This Means:**
Large contractors (construction, IT, facilities management) need Indigenous suppliers in their supply chain to win major government bids.

**Opportunity:** Position DPS as the go-to print/document supplier for Tier 1 contractors who need Indigenous participation to meet MMR targets.

**Target Contractors:**
- Major construction companies (Lendlease, CPB, Multiplex)
- Facilities management firms
- IT integrators bidding on government contracts
- Professional services firms with government contracts

---

## Part 4: Sales & Outreach Strategy

### 4.1 Government Sales Approach

**Step 1: Get Visible**
- Ensure Supply Nation profile is complete and optimized
- Register on relevant government supplier panels
- List on AusTender (Commonwealth) and state equivalent portals
- Ensure DPS appears in Indigenous Business Direct searches

**Step 2: Direct Outreach**

Target procurement officers and contract managers with this core message:

> "We supply the same HP enterprise printers available from any dealer—but purchasing from us helps you meet your Indigenous procurement targets through a simplified Exemption 16 process."

**Key Talking Points:**
- Same products, same warranties, same quality
- Simplified procurement (no tender required under Exemption 16)
- Helps meet department KPIs for Indigenous procurement
- Audit-ready with Supply Nation certification
- Queensland-based for local service

**Step 3: Timing**
- Financial year-end (May-June): Departments spending remaining budgets
- New financial year (July-August): New procurement plans being made
- Before major audits: Departments reviewing Indigenous procurement compliance

### 4.2 Corporate Sales Approach

**Step 1: Identify RAP Holders**

Use Reconciliation Australia's RAP database to identify companies with:
- Active RAPs (Elevate, Stretch, Innovate)
- Published procurement targets
- Queensland presence or operations

**Step 2: Target the Right People**

| Role | Why They Care |
|------|---------------|
| Sustainability/CSR Manager | Needs to report Indigenous procurement metrics |
| Procurement Manager | Has Indigenous supplier KPIs to meet |
| Facilities Manager | Influences equipment purchasing decisions |
| RAP Working Group | Actively seeking Indigenous supplier relationships |

**Step 3: Lead with Business Value**

Don't lead with "we're Indigenous-owned." Lead with:

> "We provide HP enterprise print solutions with managed services. We're also Indigenous-owned, which means purchasing from us supports your RAP targets and generates $4.41 of social return for every dollar spent."

**The pitch order matters:**
1. We solve your print problems with quality HP products
2. We provide excellent service and competitive pricing
3. Oh, and we also help you meet your RAP/ESG targets

### 4.3 Tier 1 Contractor Approach

**Step 1: Identify Active Bids**

Monitor AusTender for large contracts ($7.5M+) in sectors where print/document services would be required:
- Construction projects
- Facilities management contracts
- IT infrastructure projects
- Government office fit-outs

**Step 2: Approach Bidding Contractors**

Message:

> "We noticed you're bidding on [Contract]. As a Supply Nation certified Indigenous business, we can help strengthen your Indigenous Participation Plan by providing print/document solutions. This supports your 4% MMR target and improves your tender score."

**Step 3: Become a Preferred Supplier**

Goal: Get on the preferred supplier list for major contractors so you're automatically included in their Indigenous Participation Plans for future bids.

## Part 5: Pricing & Positioning Strategy

### 5.1 You Don't Need to Be Cheapest

**The Math:**

Traditional procurement evaluation:
- Price: 100%

Indigenous procurement evaluation:
- Price: ~60-70%
- Quality/capability: ~20-30%
- Social/Indigenous benefit: ~10-20%

If your price is within 10-15% of competitors, the social value component can make you the better "value for money" choice.

### 5.2 Recommended Pricing Position

| Strategy | Risk | Recommendation |
|----------|------|----------------|
| Premium pricing (20%+ above market) | High | Avoid—will lose to other Indigenous suppliers or buyers going to open market |
| Competitive pricing (within 5-10%) | Low | **Recommended**—lets social value be the tiebreaker |
| Discount pricing (below market) | Medium | Unnecessary—leaves money on table |

### 5.3 Value-Add Positioning

Instead of competing on price, compete on value:

- **Managed print services** - Ongoing relationship vs. one-time sale
- **Fleet assessment** - Help identify savings opportunities
- **Local service** - Queensland-based support
- **HP enterprise quality** - Same products, same reliability
- **Simplified procurement** - You handle the IPP compliance documentation

---

## Part 6: Marketing & Lead Generation

### 6.1 Website Strategy (Implemented)

Three dedicated pages now live on the website:

1. **`/why-indigenous`** - Explains the value proposition for all buyers
2. **`/government-procurement`** - IPP compliance guide for government buyers
3. **`/corporate-procurement`** - RAP alignment guide for corporate buyers

These pages serve SEO purposes—when procurement officers search for "Indigenous printer supplier" or "IPP compliant print services," DPS should appear.

**Important:** These pages exist for targeted searches. The main website remains product-focused (print company first, Indigenous ownership as differentiator).

### 6.2 Content Marketing Opportunities

**Blog Topics That Attract Procurement Professionals:**

- "Understanding the Indigenous Procurement Policy: A Buyer's Guide"
- "How Exemption 16 Simplifies Government Purchasing"
- "Meeting RAP Procurement Targets: A Practical Approach"
- "The Business Case for Indigenous Supplier Diversity"

**LinkedIn Strategy:**

- Share educational content about IPP (positions as expert)
- Engage with RAP announcements from target companies
- Connect with procurement professionals and sustainability managers
- Post case studies (with client permission)

### 6.3 Event & Network Opportunities

**Supply Nation Events:**
- Supply Nation Connect (annual conference)
- Regional networking events
- Industry-specific supplier showcases

**Government Procurement Events:**
- Department procurement information sessions
- Indigenous business capability showcases
- Meet-the-buyer events

**Industry Events:**
- Facilities management conferences

## Part 7: Operational Considerations

### 7.1 Maintaining Supply Nation Certification

**Requirements:**
- Annual certification renewal
- Maintain minimum 50% Indigenous ownership
- Keep documentation current (ABN, ownership structure, etc.)
- Respond to verification requests promptly

**Priority:** This certification is your key to the market. Treat renewal as a critical business process.

### 7.2 Documentation for Government Sales

Keep ready-to-go:
- Supply Nation certification (current)
- Company capability statement
- Standard pricing schedules
- Insurance certificates
- Quality/service documentation
- Reference list (once you have government clients)

### 7.3 Scaling Considerations

**As volume increases, consider:**
- Additional staff for government account management
- Dedicated tender/quote response capability
- Inventory management for faster delivery
- Service partnerships for national coverage (if needed)

---

## Part 8: Risk Factors & Mitigation

### 8.1 Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Policy changes reducing IPP requirements | Low | High | Diversify customer base; IPP has bipartisan support |
| Increased competition from other Indigenous suppliers | Medium | Medium | Focus on service quality and relationships |
| Difficulty meeting government service requirements | Medium | High | Start with smaller contracts; build capability |
| Supply chain issues affecting delivery | Medium | High | Maintain HP relationship; have backup suppliers |
| Certification issues | Low | Critical | Stay on top of renewal requirements |

### 8.2 Key Success Factors

1. **Product quality is non-negotiable** - You're selling HP enterprise products; the quality must match non-Indigenous dealers
2. **Service must be excellent** - Government buyers are taking a risk on a smaller supplier; exceed expectations
3. **Documentation must be perfect** - Government procurement is paperwork-heavy; be thorough
4. **Relationships matter** - Government buyers prefer suppliers they know and trust
5. **Stay certified** - Supply Nation certification is your market access
